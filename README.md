# Agora: A Trustless P2P Collectibles Marketplace on Solana

Agora is an open, peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace for digital collectibles, built on the Solana devnet cluster. 

## Overview

Agora aims to provide a secure, transparent, and fair platform for creators and collectors to exchange assets and payments - directly between each other - with the help of Solana Programs.

By removing middlemen and offering a common marketplace for digital collectibles, it empowers users to interact freely while ensuring security and transparency.

## Problem

* **Requires Trust or Middlement:** For a sale to occur, both parties have to trust their counter-part to honor their part of the trade or relying on a middleman. Both oth which do not guarantee success.
* **Limited optionality:** Without this platform, creators do not have access to buyers and collectors need to be connected to creators to get access to the collectibles.
* **Broken Dynamics:** Due to a lack of a proper marketplace, the principles of supply and demand do not balance each other, leading to frequent unfair trades on one side since the other party would hold more leverage in the negotiation. 

## Solution

Agora introduces a trustless trading platform that guarantees both asset and payment transfers on the Solana Blockchain.

* **Trustless Exchange:** The program ensures both sides fulfill their obligations atomically.
* **Wider Selection:** Users (both sellers and buyers) have access to a wider number of people to trade with.
* **Convenience:** Offers a single meeting point for people to meet and exchange.
